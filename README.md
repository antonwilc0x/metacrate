# MetaCrate

MetaCrate makes it possible to programmatically access meta information of your crate, such as version, authors, description, ect, using macros. It's uses code from [Clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) (**C**ommand **L**ine **A**rgument **P**arser for Rust) and was meant to exist without it, in order to not pull the entire library just to use these features when it's not needed. However, if you do need Clap, then you can safely ignore MetaCrate.
